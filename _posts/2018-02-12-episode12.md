God is calling his children to repentance. In Mark 1:15, Jesus says “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”

Align your life and priorities with God. We often fall short of his glory , and when we do, Jesus Christ challenges us to turn from our wicked ways. Re-evaluate your ways today and allow Christ to change the way you think.
