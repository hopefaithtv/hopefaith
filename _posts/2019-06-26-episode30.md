If a nation is to prosper, it begins with the home. When we succeed in our homes, what a glorious community we will have.
<br>I pray that as you watch and listen, endeavor to pursue peace and unity in your marriage while expressing bowels of mercy to one another. 

Listen as brother Bode Akindele shares this wonderful message. Be blessed.
