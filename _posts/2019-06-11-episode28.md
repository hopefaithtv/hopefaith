There are great lessons we can learn from the wedding at Cana in John 2. 
<ul>
<li>1. God is interested in your marriage. </li>
<li>2. Tell God about your problem. </li>
<li>3. Obey Gods voice in the state of your marriage. </li>
<li>4. God wants to manifest his glory. </li>
</ul>
Listen as brother Bode Akindele shares about the nuggets towards a successful marriage. 
Be blessed.
