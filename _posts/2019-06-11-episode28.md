There are great lessons we can learn from the wedding at Canaan in John 2. 1. God is interested in your marriage. 2. Tell God about your problem. 3. Obey Gods voice in the state of your marriage. 4. God wants to manifest his glory. Listen as brother Bode Akindele shares about the nuggets towards a successful marriage. 
Be blessed.
