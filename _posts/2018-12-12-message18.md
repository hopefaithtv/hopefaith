1 Peter 1:1-3 reads "I am writing to Godâ€™s chosen people who are living as foreigners in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. God the Father knew you and chose you long ago, and his Spirit has made you holy. As a result, you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ"

God knows you, has chosen you and longs to make you holy through his spirit.
