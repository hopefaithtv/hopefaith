We have been wired with the potential for sexuality. How do we respond to this? Take counsel from the word of God. The commandments of God are not burdensome. They are meant to protect us for full enjoyment in Marriage. Sexual sins are unique because they are against our own body. Listen to Part 2 of this series. Be blessed.
