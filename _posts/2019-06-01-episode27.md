From the beginning, God has planned for marriage to be good. Proverbs 18:22 reads, "He who finds a wife, finds a good and obtains favor from the lord. The needed good missing in the life of a man is a woman. She is designed by God to bring the good to man all the days of his life. Listen as brother Bode Akindele shares about the good in marriage. 
Be blessed.
