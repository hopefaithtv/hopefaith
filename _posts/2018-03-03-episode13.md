Are you experiencing rejection? Jesus Christ was despised and rejected by men. God is concerned about your life. He calls us his people and his compassion pushes him to act to do something. He knows what it means to suffer. There is hope because God rescues, saves and performs wonders and miracles. His plan is to lead us into a place of plenty from a life of slavery from sin.<br>Listen as Pastor Jamal shares this great message.
