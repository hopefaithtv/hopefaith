Jeremiah 17: 5-7: "This is what the Lord says, Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord. 6 That person will be like a bush in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. 7 â€œBut blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him."<br>
