Awakening and engaging in sexual activity has consequences. Song of Solomon 8:4 reads,"Oh, let me warn you, sisters in Jerusalem: Don’t excite love, don’t stir it up, until the time is ripe—and you’re ready". We are reminded to run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. 
Ignoring Gods counsel has real life consequences. Listen as Dr. Florence shares the final part of our series on Understanding Sexuality from a Biblical Perspective.
